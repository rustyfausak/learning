Based on the ingredients you have - main spices, pasta, ground beef, and tomato paste - I would recommend making a simple and delicious Spaghetti Bolognese. Here's the recipe:

### Spaghetti Bolognese

#### Ingredients:
- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 (6 oz) can tomato paste
- 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried basil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 12 oz spaghetti pasta

#### Instructions:
1. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5-7 minutes.
2. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the onion is translucent.
3. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, allowing the tomato paste to caramelize slightly.
4. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and beef broth. Add the dried oregano and basil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.
6. While the sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
7. Serve the Bolognese sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Enjoy!

This Spaghetti Bolognese recipe is a classic and comforting dish that makes use of the ingredients you have on hand. The ground beef, tomato paste, and spices come together to create a rich and flavorful sauce that pairs perfectly with the pasta. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your taste and enjoy!"
